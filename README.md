# Microsoft_PowerBI_Resume

Hi Everyone,

This is My Resume in Power BI Desktop

About Dashboard:
This is my Resume, I have converted my resume into Excel format and create the table for each field i.e. Technical Skillset Education, Professional Certification, Work Experience.
Then all fields are converted into visualization form so we can easily Visualize data.

For creating a dashboard I follow some steps as follows
Step 1: Extract data
Step 2: Transform data
Step 3: Load data
Step 3: Data Modeling
Step 4: Writing DAX
Step 5: Report Building
Step 6: Publish Report
Step 7: Dashboard Creation
Step 8: Share & Collaborate
